# ðŸŒ¨ Cloudflare ZTNA Info

"Zero Trust Network Access" is a method of allowing a remote device to access data and information located at another location. The term "Zero Trust" refers to the Cybersecurity concept of assuming all resources should be untrusted until proven otherwise. This is also the main difference between ZTNA and the Virtual Private Network, or VPN, connections you may already be using. With ZTNA, every resource is protected on its own with virtual walls blocking all other resources. Whereas with a VPN, you automatically gain full access to an entire network

## Using ZTNA

In your computers task bar to the left of the clock, similar to your existing VPN, you will find the following icon:&#x20;

This is the icon for Cloudflare, the security provider eTop Technology has partnered with to bring you your remote network access. When you click this link, you will be shown a toggle switch to enable or disable your access.&#x20;

Similar to your VPN, this should be enabled when you work outside the office and disabled when working from within the physical office network. The ZTNA application will also attempt to identify your location and automatically enable or disable as need
