# ðŸ“… Using Teams

### Teams getting started

Office 365 includes Teams in almost all licenses that would be applied to our users!&#x20;

[https://teams.microsoft.com/](https://teams.microsoft.com/) You can access teams here or from the installed teams app on your PC. You will need to login with your office 365 username and password.&#x20;

### Teams Messaging

You should be added by your manager to the teams that your organization uses. In our case we have Several Teams (a group of people) with multiple channels under the team. The channel communications are very much a collaborative effort and communications shouldn't be treated as a DM(direct message)&#x20;

We highly recommend keeping individual issues or topics in a team channel -> topic so it becomes useable in the future. Our internal policies at eTop for our Technical Channels are as follows.

### Technical General is to discuss technical issues

* ticket questions \*
* general outages with services
* maintenance issues

\*To ask for assistance with a ticket, **please include the ticket number, client name, subject, and a link to the ticket within Manage.** Describe as succinctly as possible what is going on and what you need assistance with. This a great place to brainstorm troubleshooting steps or determine if something needs escalation&#x20;

### Direct Messaging

Direct Messaging should be for issues and communications that only concern 1 or 2 people at a time. They function as you would normally expect direct communications to go. As an example eTop requires technical discussions that need insight to go to Tech Gen in the formatting above!

### Video Meetings

Teams allows users to book meetings with others in the same organization or with clients/prospects. If you navigate to the Calendar button (teams integrates with your existing outlook calendar) You can choose new meeting inside teams and start/manage meetings!
